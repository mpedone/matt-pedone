                <h1 id="about">I. About Me</h1>
                <p>In 1997, I enrolled at the University of New Hampshire where I spent some time exploring subjects such as Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science before settling in to work through a dual major program, earning degrees in Mathematics and English.</p>
                
                <p>While in school, I worked for UNH's InterOperability Lab, a group of consortiums that laid the groundwork for the Internet as we know it now, providing resources for any telecommunication company to ensure the compatability of their equipment with anything else that might be out there. I worked in the DSL consortium, testing DSL modems and backend devices to confirm that equipment from different companies could work together, and provide feedback to companies if it didn't. Lots of hands-on testing with new devices against the IEEE specs for DSL.</p>
                
                <p>After college, I struggled for a bit finding my path. I tried my hand at graphic and web design, where I started to learn HTML and CSS, and led me to my first full-time job as a text book compositor. My design skills were utilized in taking customer input and building specs for myself and other compositors to use in laying out the pages. Some interpretation required!</p>

                <p>As valuable as my design skills was my general knowledge of computers. In that role, I worked in every system we had, bouncing between Mac and Windows, and several different software packages.  Adobe alone had two different layout packages, both vastly different. I also had to work occasionally in XML and XPP - a sort of hybrid of CSS and XML.</p>

                <p>During that time, I started performing some freelance IT and tech-support work for the company that ran the ticketing for a couple of local fairs. They provided point-of-sale equipment - touch-screen registers, ticket printers, and ticket scanners - as well as online sales and will-call orders. I acted as on-site tech support, handling any technical issues that arose, as well as setting up in the morning and shutting down sales at night. In addition, I trained new sellers and was on-site throughout the day responded to a variety of issues, from printers not working, to the touch screens not working, and customer order issues.</p>

                <p>This led me to Seahorse Bioscience in 2012. My friend's wife was a manager, and had lost a team member, leaving her with just one. I was a little surprised when she urged me to apply, as I have almost no biology or lab work in my background, but she knew the work, and knew me, and thought I could handle it. I admit I was overwhelmed at first, but I learned so much about lab work, biology, and the instrument, and the software, that it wasn’t long before I was a vital member of the team. Over the next few years, our team grew, and we each started to have our own focus. Mine was on validation and verification, and leaned more towards the software side. (work in R/data processing here? Daily sprint meetings, Jira)</p>
                <p>In 2015, Seahorse was acquired by Agilent Technologies, and not much changed, though we moved from Billerica to a fancier office space in Lexington. I continued to learn R and data processing, and was promoted from associate to engineer, and my focus shifted even more towards software testing, helping build and maintain test grids, as well as writing and executing test cases for hardware projects.</p>
                <p>In 2019, we had released a cloud-based version of the software, and were building automated tests to make the testing of it more efficient. I learned C# and Selenium to help with this project.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, over the past couple of years, with sales slumping, Agilent had been forced to undergo some restructuring. It started early in the year, but wasn’t enough, and this summer they decided that they needed to eliminate several roles, and sadly, mine was one of them. I am proud of the work I did there and grateful for the role for introducing me to the world of software testing and development. Since the separation, I have spent time deepening my understanding of programming languages and the software world, and look forward to my next role in this field.</p>
